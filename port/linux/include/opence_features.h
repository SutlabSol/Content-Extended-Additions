/*
OPENCE_FEATURES.H

Central feature toggle header for OpenCE-Firefight / Forge / Service Rank /
Achievements / Extended Challenges modules merged into OpenCE Ultimate Campaign.

Set any toggle to 0 (or remove its standalone .c file) to disable that feature
cleanly without breaking the rest of the build.
