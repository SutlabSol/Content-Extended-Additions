/*
TAG_PACK.H

The tag packs (tag_pack.c): tag_pack/<name>.pack, each a few maps' tags and
the pixels and samples a manifest keeps of them (port/assets/tag_packs:
port/linux/src/port_tag_packs.c), written once by the main menu from the
maps in maps/, on a thread of their own behind a checklist, and read by the tag importer
(tag_import.c) as a level loads. port/linux/TAG_INJECTION.md tells how to
make one.
