/*
CUSTOM_EDITION_MAPS.H

Custom Edition maps in the menus. With game.custom_edition on, the CE maps
of the custom_maps folder are listed: the multiplayer maps after the Xbox
levels in the multiplayer level list (ui_widget_event_handler_functions.c),
and both kinds in the map lists' CUSTOM SINGLEPLAYER and CUSTOM MULTIPLAYER
(port/linux/game/menu_functions.c). A CE map's level name is
custom_maps\<name> (custom_edition_cache.h).

The menus that show a level (ui_widget_game_data_input_functions.c) refer
to it by an index into their own tags' strings and frames. Maps that the
tags don't have get "display indices" past those, and text_group.c and
ui_widget.c ask this file for their names, descriptions and pictures.

	below 0x1000   Xbox multiplayer level (the tags' own index)
	0x3000 + n     stock campaign level n (co-op)
	0x4000 + n     CE multiplayer map
	0x6000 + n     CE campaign map (played alone or as co-op)
